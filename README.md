A program that converts weight units to other weight units

So, when you open up the program, type in a number, and click a button.
e.g: If you typed in "1" and click the button that reads "kg to lb", it would convert 1 KG into it's value in LBs,
and output the answer, in this case "2".

That's pretty much it.

The math formulas used are 99.99% exact.
